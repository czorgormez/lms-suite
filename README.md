# LMS Suite

Utilities for use with hardware based upon FPRF transceivers from Lime Microsystems.

The utilities:

* can be used to calibrate the transceiver;
* allow configuration of the transceiver plus support devices such as clock generators;
* provide an FFT display.

## LMS7002M

### LMS7002Mr2

This version of LMS Suite is for use with the [Stream board](https://myriadrf.org/projects/stream/) and LMS7002EVB (UNITE).
